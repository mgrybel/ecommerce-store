## Setup

Download the project's code from this GitHub repository. Once you have downloaded and unzipped the project, open it in Visual Studio Code.<br /><br />

Before you install and start the application, you must first set up Cloudinary and Stripe, as well as backend and frontend environment variables for the project.

### Setting up Cloudinary

1. First, create a new, free Cloudinary account. Next, log in to Cloudinary.
2. On the Cloudinary Dashboard, in the **Product Environment** section, click **Go to API keys**.
3. Next, in Visual Studio Code, open the **backend/API/appsettings.json** file, and in the **Cloudinary** property, paste the values from the page **API Keys** in Cloudinary:

- set the value of the key **CloudName** to the value of the **Cloud name** from Cloudinary (copy and paste the value from Cloudinary, right next to the page title API Keys, on the light blue background)
- set the value of the key **ApiKey** to the value of the **API Key** from Cloudinary (copy and paste the value from Cloudinary)
- set the value of the key **ApiSecret** to the value of the value of the **API Secret** from Cloudinary (copy and paste the value from Cloudinary)

### Setting up Stripe

1. First, create a new, free Stripe account. Next, log in to Stripe.
2. On the Stripe dashboard, in the top left corner, select the **Create a new account** option.
3. In the modal window "Create a new account", set the name to **E-commerce Store** and the country of operation to the **United States**. Next, click the **Create** button.
4. On the next screen, click the **Go to Dashboard** button.
5. On the Stripe dashboard for the **E-commerce Store** sandbox, in the middle of the page on the right, there is a section called **API keys** with two keys: **Publishable key** and **Secret key**.
6. In Visual Studio Code, open the **backend/API/appsettings.Development.json** file and in the **StripeSettings** property:

- set the value of the key **PublishableKey** to the value of the **Publishable key** from the Stripe dashboard (copy and paste the value from the Stripe dashboard)
- set the value of the key **SecretKey** to the value of the **Secret key** from the Stripe dashboard (copy and paste the value from the Stripe dashboard)

7. Next, in Stripe, go to **Settings**, select **Payment methods**, and turn off all the payment methods except for **Cards** (this one should stay active).

### Setting up Stripe coupons

1. Log in to Stripe. On the Stripe dashboard, from the menu on the left, select **Product catalog**.
2. On the **Product catalog** page, select the **Coupons** tab and click the **Create test coupon** button.
3. For the new coupon, set the following values:

- Type: Percentage discount
- Percentage off: 10
- Duration: Forever
- Code: select the option "Use customer-facing code" and add code **FRIENDS10** in the Code input field

4. Next, click the **Create coupon** button.

### Setting up frontend environment variables

1. In Visual Studio Code, in the **frontend** directory, create a new file: **.env**

2. In this file, add the **VITE_API_URL** variable and set it as follows:

```
VITE_API_URL=https://localhost:5001/api
```

3. The second variable you need to add is **VITE_STRIPE_PK**, and you have to set it to the value of the **Publishable key** from the Stripe dashboard (it is the same value as in the **PublishableKey** in the **backend/API/appsettings.Development.json** file you've set up earlier):

```
VITE_STRIPE_PK=pk_test_your_publishable_key
```

## Installation

In Visual Studio Code, navigate to the menu on the top, click **Terminal**, and select **New Terminal**. Next, select **Split Terminal**.<br /><br />
As a result, you will have two Terminal windows side-by-side, and that will allow you to operate in parallel on the two Terminals and run commands for both the backend and frontend parts of the application at the same time.

### 1. Backend

In the first Terminal window, from the **root** directory, run the following command:

```
cd backend/API
```

First, you need to generate on your local machine a self-signed certificate that enables HTTPS use in local web application development. You can do that by running the following commands in the first Terminal window, from the **backend/api** directory:

```
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
```

```
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

After running these two commands, in the first Terminal window, you should see the message: "Successfully created and trusted a new HTTPS certificate."<br /><br />

Next, in the first Terminal window, from the **backend/api** directory, run the following command:

```
dotnet watch
```

### 2. Frontend

In the second Terminal window, from the **root** directory, run the following commands:

```
cd frontend
```

```
npm install
```

## Running the application

To run the application, you must have both the backend and frontend up and running.

### 1. Running the backend

To run the backend part of the application, in the first Terminal window, from the **backend/API** directory, run the following command:

```
dotnet watch
```

### 2. Running the frontend

To run the frontend part of the application, in the second Terminal window, from the **frontend** directory, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

## Viewing the application

Go to https://localhost:3000/ to view the application.<br /><br />
